# Debugging Best Practices

- Always enable detailed error messages in FastAPI (set `debug=True`) during testing to quickly identify response structure issues and other errors.
- Question initial assumptions and start with the basics before diving into complex mocking or configuration changes.
- Iterate quickly through potential solutions, starting with the simplest and most direct ones to save time and avoid unnecessary complexity.

# Always remember add PYTHONPATH when there is an app not found error

# Notice the `micronutrient` conda env must be created before you run anything within terminal
