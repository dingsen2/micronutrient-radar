## 1. Overview
This document outlines the technical plan and phased roadmap for the Micronutrient Radar product. It details key deliverables, technical milestones, dependencies, and risk management strategies to ensure successful and timely delivery.

---

## 2. Phases & Milestones

### Phase 0: Project Bootstrap
- Stack selection (frontend, backend, cloud, CI/CD)
- Repository setup & branching strategy
- Initial infrastructure (dev/staging/prod environments)
- Team onboarding

### Phase 1: Core Receipt Ingestion & OCR
- Implement image/PDF upload and camera capture
- Integrate Tesseract.js (offline OCR)
- Fallback to cloud OCR (with user consent)
- PII redaction pipeline
- Receipt parse confidence scoring & review UI
- Unit and integration tests for ingestion pipeline

### Phase 2: Nutrition Mapping & Data Model
- UPC and fuzzy string matching to USDA FDC
- LLM-based fallback for ambiguous items
- Core data model implementation (User, Receipt, LineItem, NutrientLedger)
- Secure storage and encryption
- API endpoints for CRUD operations
- Data validation and error handling

### Phase 3: Analytics, Radar Chart & Recommendations
- Nutrient aggregation logic (rolling 7-day window)
- Radar chart visualization (responsive, accessible)
- Gap-filler recommendation engine
- Weekly summary job (PNG generation, email/push delivery)
- Shareable radar export (server-side PNG)

### Phase 4: User Experience & Feedback Loop
- Onboarding questionnaire & profile management
- User correction loop (manual nutrient edits, feedback to matcher)
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA compliance, alt-table views)
- Internationalization (units, currency, date formats, RTL support)

### Phase 5: Monitoring, Scaling & Security
- Logging, metrics, and alerting (structured logs, error tracking)
- Performance and load testing
- Auto-scaling and queue management
- Security hardening (encryption, key rotation, rate limiting, MFA)
- GDPR/export/delete flows

### Phase 6: Beta & Launch
- Internal testflight/staging
- QA hardening, bug triage, and P0 fixes
- Documentation (API, user, internal)
- Production launch

---

## 3. Key Deliverables
- Functional ingestion and OCR pipeline
- Secure, scalable backend and data model
- Accurate nutrition mapping and aggregation
- Actionable, accessible user insights (radar, recommendations)
- Automated weekly summary delivery
- Robust monitoring, alerting, and compliance
- Comprehensive documentation

---

## 4. Technical Dependencies
- Tesseract.js (OCR)
- USDA FoodData Central API
- OpenAI/LLM provider
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (push)
- SendGrid (email)
- Cloud provider (for scaling, storage, backups)

---

## 5. Risk Management
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| OCR accuracy on poor-quality receipts | Multi-tier fallback, user review UI, model retraining |
| API rate limits (USDA, LLM) | Caching, batching, monitoring, fallback logic |
| Data privacy & PII exposure | Client-side OCR by default, PII redaction, encryption |
| Scaling bottlenecks | Auto-scaling, queue monitoring, load testing |
| Accessibility gaps | Early audits, manual and automated testing |
| Delayed external dependencies | Mocking, feature flags, parallel development |

---

## 6. Timeline (Draft)
| Phase | Duration | Target Completion |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| 0 | 1 week | March 2024 |
| 1 | 2 weeks | March 2024 |

| 4 | 2 weeks | May 2024 |
| 5 | 2 weeks | May 2024 |
| 6 | 1 week | May 2024 |

---

## 7. Documentation & Communication
- Weekly engineering standups
- Sprint demo and review sessions
- Living documentation in repo (README, API docs, architecture diagrams)
- Slack/Teams for async updates
