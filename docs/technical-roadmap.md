## 2. Phases & Milestones

### Phase 0: Project Bootstrap
- Stack selection (frontend, backend, cloud, CI/CD)
- Repository setup & branching strategy
- Initial infrastructure (dev/staging/prod environments)
- Team onboarding

### Phase 1: Core Food Image Processing
- Implement image upload and camera capture
- Integrate LLM-based food recognition pipeline
- Implement confidence scoring & review UI
- Unit and integration tests for image processing pipeline

### Phase 2: Nutrition Mapping & Data Model
- Implement LLM-based nutrient estimation pipeline
  - Create test suite for nutrient estimation
  - Implement nutrient value validation
  - Add comprehensive error handling
  - Implement retry logic for failed API calls
- Design and implement nutrient caching system
  - Implement in-memory cache (v1)
  - Migrate to persistent database storage (v2)
  - Add cache invalidation strategy
  - Implement cache warming for common foods
- Core data model implementation
  - User, FoodImage, FoodItem models
  - NutrientProfile model with caching
  - NutrientLedger for aggregation
- Secure storage and encryption
- API endpoints for CRUD operations
- Data validation and error handling
- Unit conversion system (metric/imperial)
- Performance optimization
  - Implement batch processing for nutrient estimation
  - Add parallel processing for multiple items
  - Optimize LLM prompts for accuracy
  - Add request queuing system

### Phase 3: Analytics, Radar Chart & Recommendations
- Nutrient aggregation logic (rolling 7-day window)
- Radar chart visualization (responsive, accessible)
- Gap-filler recommendation engine
- Weekly summary job (PNG generation, email/push delivery)
- Shareable radar export (server-side PNG)

### Phase 4: User Experience & Feedback Loop
- Onboarding questionnaire & profile management
- User correction loop
  - Manual nutrient edits
  - Feedback to matcher
  - Confidence score adjustments
- Progress tracking and notifications
  - Real-time processing status
  - Error notifications
  - Success confirmations
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA compliance, alt-table views)
- Internationalization (units, currency, date formats, RTL support)

### Phase 5: Monitoring, Scaling & Security
- Logging, metrics, and alerting (structured logs, error tracking)
- Performance and load testing
- Auto-scaling and queue management
- Security hardening (encryption, key rotation, rate limiting, MFA)
- GDPR/export/delete flows

### Phase 6: Beta & Launch
- Internal testflight/staging
- QA hardening, bug triage, and P0 fixes
- Documentation (API, user, internal)
- Production launch

---

## 3. Key Deliverables
- Functional ingestion and OCR pipeline
- Secure, scalable backend and data model
- Accurate nutrition mapping and aggregation
- Actionable, accessible user insights (radar, recommendations)
- Automated weekly summary delivery
- Robust monitoring, alerting, and compliance
- Comprehensive documentation

---

## 4. Technical Dependencies
- OpenAI/LLM provider (for food recognition and nutrient estimation)
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (push)
- SendGrid (email)
- Cloud provider (for scaling, storage, backups)
